                                                    They have a parking garage, but they make you leave your vehicle for them to park   and then if you want to take a drive later, you have to wait for the staff to get it .\\n4                                                                                                                                                                                       There is no real parking space, so I had to pull up in front of the hotel in a small space .\\n5

                                     Our ONLY complaint was one doorman valet wasn't thrilled about us parking the car at the front \\n8

    There is a parking ramp across the street that is MUCH cheaper then hotel parking .\\n10                                                                                                                                         Our room rate was all in order \\u0096 we\\u0092d booked a TravelZoo special, and the front desk had the right rate, and the right parking discount .\\n11                                                                                                                               Of course you have the added thrill of paying over $40 a night for parking and whatever your chiropractor bill is when you are done with the beds .\\n12

                                     Parking is expensive, Rooms are on the small side .\\n15

                                                                                                                                                                                             Only other

quiet, clean with good beds but very very smallnot a cheap hotelvalit parking was to much expencive but oke its the location\\n18

.\\n19                                                                                                                                                                                                      Parking is expensive   and everything is very much within walking distance .\\n20                                                                                                                                             Valet parking is, in my view, unreasonably high at $38 per night, but again we knew this before we arrived so can't really complain .\\n21                                                                                                                                  As most hotels in the city, parking is expensive so unless you really need a vehicle it\\u0092s cheaper to just buy a MUNI Passport during your stay .\\n22                                                                                                                                                                                  The hotel does have parking, but it is expensive and hard to get around the city while driving .\\n23                                                                                                                                                                  The parking was steep  , so if I had to do it again I would have parked 1 2 block north for about half of that .\\n24                                                                                                                                                                                              Parking at $45 a night was outrageous, but probably worth it to keep your car safe .\\n25                                                                                                                                                                                                                               We did not have a car, hotel parking is expensive .\\n26                                                                                                                                                                                          The valet parking was very convenient and seemed secure as it is attached to the hotel .\\n27                                                                                                                                                                                       A lot of hotel parking garages lots are not on the same premises as the hotel in the area .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                                                            First, the biggest &quot gotcha&quot  is the mandatory valet parking .\\n29                                                                                                                               Not trying to bad mouth the Tuscan, it is a nice place to stay, and if you're not put off by the valet parking, you shouldn't be too disappointed .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                              Valet parking for $40 per night seems a bit steep,but at least the service was efficient and quick .\\n31                                                                                                                                                                          The prize for vallet parking is steep but I think you can expect that anywhere you go in San Francisco .\\n32                                                                                                                                                     Valet parking was $45 per night with tax, but that includes in and out privileges and my car was there whenever I needed it .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Watch out for steep parking rates of about $45 per night .\\n34                                                                                                                                                                                                              This total includes the taxes and tips for mandatory valet parking .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Aside from the parking rate, you won't be disappointed .\\n36                                                                           The other thing that I found disappointing was I can't remember the exact details but something like the charge they quote for parking   was even more than that because there was some sort of a tax .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Onsite parking is available .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                             I called before we ever arrived to inquire about it and was told that parking was no problem at all .\\n39                                                                                              I guess calling to inquire about parking while giving them our name and reservation dates didn't warrant the clerk to inform us that we should make a reservation for our car also .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                                                            Valet parking is provided at $36 day which was, I thought, excessive .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                Walgreens has same souvenirs the airport shops do for 1 2 $Do not rent a car, waste of time, money,   no parking !\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                              The valet parking was overpriced, the service was terrible, and the coffe was cold .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          At the hotel, it is valet only parking .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Check for Internet deals and don't pay for their parking .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                            I do think that if you are staying at a hotel you should not have to pay for parking .\\n46                                                                                        The hotel, located a few blocks from Fisherman's Wharf as well as Ghiardelli Square, has a nice Italian theme that carries into the lobby as well as the uniforms for the parking valets .\\n47                                                                                                                     Speaking of parking, you're going to have to pay and it's going to have to be valet service, as there are no free self park lots that are part of the hotel .\\n48                                                                                                     Not only is it pricey at $36 day, but having nothing but valet parking means you have no access to your car unless you have one of the valets fetch it from the lot for you .\\n49   Although our room was indeed non, smoking   and we had a king size bed we ended up on the 3rd floor and our room, facing Mason Street, overlooked a concrete multi, story parking lot although if you stood at the window you could see the Coit Tower which was a nicer view !\\n50                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Several have mentioned the charge for parking .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                     It really does save if you can get a deal with free parking, but the fee is not out of line .\\n52                                                                                                                               Valet parking was $36 a day, but we're not complaining because other SF wharf hotels have charged us a similar fee even without the valet service .\\n53

                                                                                                                                                    They do a good job and are a heck of a lot cheaper than a cab and you won\\u0092t have to mess with the parking fees .\\n55

was the free parking .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                                                 Normally parking is $36 a night so getting that thrown in was a fantastic steal .\\n58                                                                                                                                      We stayed at the BW Tuscan Inn only because they were offering a great winter deal , $99 for a room with king, size bed and free parking   .\\n59                                                                                                                                                          Overall, we would recommend this place to friends, especially if they are able to get a good discount and free parking .\\n60

                                                    They have a parking garage, but they make you leave your vehicle for them to park   and then if you want to take a drive later, you have to wait for the staff to get it .\\n4                                                                                                                                                                                       There is no real parking space, so I had to pull up in front of the hotel in a small space .\\n5

                                     Our ONLY complaint was one doorman valet wasn't thrilled about us parking the car at the front \\n8

    There is a parking ramp across the street that is MUCH cheaper then hotel parking .\\n10                                                                                                                                         Our room rate was all in order \\u0096 we\\u0092d booked a TravelZoo special, and the front desk had the right rate, and the right parking discount .\\n11                                                                                                                               Of course you have the added thrill of paying over $40 a night for parking and whatever your chiropractor bill is when you are done with the beds .\\n12

                                                                                                                                                                                             Only other

quiet, clean with good beds but very very smallnot a cheap hotelvalit parking was to much expencive but oke its the location\\n18

.\\n19

                        Valet parking is, in my view, unreasonably high at $38 per night, but again we knew this before we arrived so can't really complain .\\n21                                                                                                                                  As most hotels in the city, parking is expensive so unless you really need a vehicle it\\u0092s cheaper to just buy a MUNI Passport during your stay .\\n22                                                                                                                                                                                  The hotel does have parking, but it is expensive and hard to get around the city while driving .\\n23                                                                                                                                                                  The parking was steep  , so if I had to do it again I would have parked 1 2 block north for about half of that .\\n24                                                                                                                                                                                              Parking at $45 a night was outrageous, but probably worth it to keep your car safe .\\n25                                                                                                                                                                                                                               We did not have a car, hotel parking is expensive .\\n26                                                                                                                                                                                          The valet parking was very convenient and seemed secure as it is attached to the hotel .\\n27                                                                                                                                                                                       A lot of hotel parking garages lots are not on the same premises as the hotel in the area .\\n28

                                                                                                                              Not trying to bad mouth the Tuscan, it is a nice place to stay, and if you're not put off by the valet parking, you shouldn't be too disappointed .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                              Valet parking for $40 per night seems a bit steep,but at least the service was efficient and quick .\\n31                                                                                                                                                                          The prize for vallet parking is steep but I think you can expect that anywhere you go in San Francisco .\\n32                                                                                                                                                     Valet parking was $45 per night with tax, but that includes in and out privileges and my car was there whenever I needed it .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Watch out for steep parking rates of about $45 per night .\\n34                                                                                                                                                                                                              This total includes the taxes and tips for mandatory valet parking .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Aside from the parking rate, you won't be disappointed .\\n36                                                                           The other thing that I found disappointing was I can't remember the exact details but something like the charge they quote for parking   was even more than that because there was some sort of a tax .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Onsite parking is available .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                             I called before we ever arrived to inquire about it and was told that parking was no problem at all .\\n39                                                                                              I guess calling to inquire about parking while giving them our name and reservation dates didn't warrant the clerk to inform us that we should make a reservation for our car also .\\n40

                                                                                                                 Walgreens has same souvenirs the airport shops do for 1 2 $Do not rent a car, waste of time, money,   no parking !\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                              The valet parking was overpriced, the service was terrible, and the coffe was cold .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          At the hotel, it is valet only parking .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Check for Internet deals and don't pay for their parking .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                            I do think that if you are staying at a hotel you should not have to pay for parking .\\n46                                                                                        The hotel, located a few blocks from Fisherman's Wharf as well as Ghiardelli Square, has a nice Italian theme that carries into the lobby as well as the uniforms for the parking valets .\\n47                                                                                                                     Speaking of parking, you're going to have to pay and it's going to have to be valet service, as there are no free self park lots that are part of the hotel .\\n48                                                                                                     Not only is it pricey at $36 day, but having nothing but valet parking means you have no access to your car unless you have one of the valets fetch it from the lot for you .\\n49   Although our room was indeed non, smoking   and we had a king size bed we ended up on the 3rd floor and our room, facing Mason Street, overlooked a concrete multi, story parking lot although if you stood at the window you could see the Coit Tower which was a nicer view !\\n50                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Several have mentioned the charge for parking .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                     It really does save if you can get a deal with free parking, but the fee is not out of line .\\n52                                                                                                                               Valet parking was $36 a day, but we're not complaining because other SF wharf hotels have charged us a similar fee even without the valet service .\\n53

                                                                                                                                                    They do a good job and are a heck of a lot cheaper

was the free parking .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                                                 Normally parking is $36 a night so getting that thrown in was a fantastic steal .\\n58

they are able to get a good discount and free parking .\\n60

the route as a series of turn by turn directions .\\n3

directions   .\\n4                                                                                                                                                                             The widescreen is a plus and I highly recommend it, even though it has the wide screen you can stick it in your back pocket which can be conveniently used for walking directions .\\n5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Garmin's nuvi 255W   is a handy little device that provides excellent value, but more importantly spot on directions .\\n6                                                 While I recommend that you refrain from entering a directions request while driving your car, I note that some of the more impressive features of this GPS are literally one touch away, and so mounting the device close enough to you to activite a one touch feature would seem to be relatively important .\\n7                                                                                                       But leaving it on the seat next to you is likely to cause a few double takes because as comfortable as you think you're going to be just listening for directions, the fact remains that the graphics will attract your eyeballs like a moth to a flame .\\n8                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I've found the directions in major metropolitan areas to be excellent .\\n9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               but for the most part, we find that the Garmin software provides accurate directions, whereever we intend to go .\\n10                                                                                                                                         Another screen at the touch of the button will show you the turn by turn directions coming up so that you can plan even better, especially in areas that you have just enough familiarity to be considered dangerous .\\n11                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I like how the Garmin 255W doesn't make you type in complete directions when it isn't necessary .\\n12                                                                                                                                       The only other annoyance of any time is that if you deviate from your route and don't indicate that you are detouring, you get to hear the Garmin repeatedly chastize you because it has to recalulate your directions .\\n13                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   No more firing up the computer, going to the site, printing the directions .\\n14                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     It speaks the directions so that you don't have to keep looking down at a piece of paper .\\n15                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     It allows for detours with directions on how to get back .\\n16

you don't have to call and ask for directions .\\n17

.\\n18                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          In closing, this is a fantastic GPS with some very nice features and is very accurate in directions .\\n19                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The sound is tolerable, but when you are hearing spoken directions a lot, it gets really annoying .\\n20

Southwest Drive exit, or the Buffalo Gap Road exit, like the highway sign says, or like I would verbally tell someone to take if giving them directions .\\n33

although the Nuvi doesn't verbalize those directions, I can look at the screen to see the exit I need to take .\\n34

the device enough to know if it can be set to avoid Interstates .\\n35

skipped directions .\\n36

on the screen, I find the occasional mispronunciation entertaining and not an issue .\\n39

it cannot give directions to the road .\\n40

 My only real gripes on the software interface side would be its inability to show 1, way streets on your overhead map   and that this particular model does not support the Garmin routing feature that you can sync between your PC and their more expensive models to pick multiple waypoints instead of just a point 'A' to point 'B' directions system .\\n42

turn, by, turn directions from the program, and Google Maps has features that work with Garmin units .\\n43                                                                                                                                         Any time you're facing a closed roadway or are terribly stuck in highway traffic, you'll get a very slick change in directions to your destination given to you in literally less than 5 seconds than you ask for it .\\n44

                                                        The voice directions are great, but sometimes it mispronounces names .\\n47

by the time I'm out on the road and actually need directions it's up and going .\\n48

driving one day in downtown Sacramento .\\n49

                                                                                                                                                                                    I avoided the more complex ones as I had read that FM updates can confuse the device and changing directions after the obstruction has been cleared is not a good option .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                        I like being able to select different voices, however when I am using Daniel with the English accent, he seems to be clearing his throat at the end of his directions .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            It loads quickly, have pretty accurate directions, and can recalculate quickly when I miss a turn .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                                                        Often when I'd get a phone call or was talking to someone, it would have been nice to just have the ability to quickly make the voice directions mute .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The directions were pretty right on, with a brief glitch with the distance it was calculating for some approaching streets .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                     I am sure I've not even touched upon the many features this GPS boasts, but for basic travel directions for the non, techie then this is a great product .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          My daughter would then call my wife, asking her to plot a course using a mapping Web site and recite the directions .\\n57                                                                                                                   Daughter Dearest now carries the Nuvi in the glove box of her car, pulling it out, plugging it in, and getting directions whenever she needs, in a manner that notably is much faster and clearer than reading a map or calling her mother .\\n58                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    When it comes to directions, I'm horrible .\\n59                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         There are different voices you can choose to give you your directions, even Australian, American and British English .\\n60                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I mainly bought the first one for my wife since she needs directions alot of the time .\\n61                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              It worked so well that people from the wedding were following me for directions .\\n62                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         In the week that I have had it, it's been spot on in providing directions and keeps up with the speed I am traveling .\\n63                                                                                                                                    The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .\\n64                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Amazon had the best price for this model which I chose for its ability to adjust the directions if you reroute, text to speech feature and 4 .\\n65                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    For the first time in several years, my husband & I took a roadtrip with no  squabbling  about directions .\\n66                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Directions and maps are easy to use, and if you miss a turn, it updates your route in seconds .\\n67                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        It has worked well for local driving giving accurate directions for roads and streets .\\n68                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I was so tired of having to go to Mapquest and print out directions .\\n69                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The voice directions give you fair warning when you are about to take a turn, which is really important .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                                              What the 255w does best is find a street address, business, point of interest, hospital or airport and give you turn, by, turn directions with amazing accuracy .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I would have struggled to find with my usual combination of maps and Web, based directions .\\n72                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The directions the GPS gave me were absolutely correct  , but the name of the highway was wrong .\\n73                                                                                                                                                                                                     Wish I had bought it about two years ago rather than spend a lot on maps and wasting time asking directions, especially in relatively remote areas of ME .\\n74

     I spent 2 weeks driving around the Mid, West following Mapquest maps and directions .\\n75                                                                                                                                             I chose small towns as destinations and it always led me there without any problems, thus allowing me to enjoy the scenery of the fall foliage without worrying about using a map for directions or getting lost .\\n76                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I use the map feature when I don't need directions which makes it easier to identify streets when street signs are obscured or missing  .\\n77                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    On the negative side, the directions it gives to a given address are not always the best way to get there .\\n78

Practiced visiting places I already knew to see how accurate the directions and maps would be .\\n84

it's not there until you need it and then it's there waiting for you to with all the directions to get you to your destination .\\n88                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I had no trouble with the volume level of the spoken directions either and found it to be an interesting and helpful tool .\\n89

both directions and street names, etc .\\n90                                                                                                                                                                          After a certain amount of frustration dealing with paper maps, missed exits and fumbling for directions in the dark ,  I decided it was time to get on the GPS car navigation wagon .\\n91                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Also, there is there no asking for directions from passengers like spouses and children who have difficulty reading conventional paper maps .\\n92                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Others have said that the voice directions leave something to be desired in terms of volume and clarity .\\n93                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            It was accurate on determing original directions and recalculating when necessary .\\n94

just 70% of volume .\\n95                                                                                                                                                                               I didnt know the address of the mueseum so I typed it into the unit and it found not only the meuseum, but the nearest garage, the places to eat, and directions were right ON .\\n96                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The display is very easy to read, and the directions were very good .\\n97                                                                                                                                                                               The model 255W that we received seemed to take longer to find a satelite, and the man's voice was very fast and not as clear, and at times seemed a bit confused in directions .\",\n          \"                                                                                                                                                          Another feature on the 255w is a display of the posted speed limit on the road which you are currently on right above your current displayed speed .\\n0                                                                                                                                                                   I found myself not even looking at my car speedometer as I could easily see my current speed and the speed limit of my route at a glance .\\n1                                                                                                                                        My final decision was to keep the 255w and return the 750 because I really liked the graphic turn indicator and the posted speed limit and current speed indicators .\\n2

                                                    The new display posts speed limit signs of major roads flush left on the screen, which is a new feature that is also really helpful, if you're driving in an unfamiliar area .\\n4                                                                                                          Display is excellent ,  the layout of information on the

the name of the game for thieves is speed .\\n6                                                                                                                                                                  With a reset button, you can track your max speed, moving time, stopped time, average speed total for the trip, average moving speed, etc .\\n7

which will change depending upon your stops and speed .\\n8                                                                                                                                  Well, you can one up him now by not only announcing the time, but the average speed as well, and you have documented proof of the reason you were delayed for precisely 7 .\\n9

                            ,  Speed of map updates is awesome .\\n10                                                                                                                                 The navigation display shows more information, such as next turn street and speed limit, and the picture update is smooth instead of jerky as I have seen in other models .\\n11                                                                                                                                                                                                            TomTom seems to underestimate speed limits on community highways and gives sub, optimal routes .\\n12                                                 For example, on the route from Rocky Mountain National park to Arches National Park Garmin's route is 40 mins shorter on a 7 hour drive because it chooses shorter route along minor highways instead of longer route along I, 70 with higher speed limit .\\n13

beware that Garmin expects you to drive with a speed close to speed limit along NYC streets .\\n14

.\\n15   That newer interface, as another reviewer has mentioned, gives you speed limits on some major roads, shows you your current speed, puts the zoom buttons closer together, changes text size to give you road names, and shows you the direction of the next upcoming turn near the distance to the turn .\\n16

behind in changing the speed limit on the screen .\\n25                                                                                                                                 I can see that

bathroom was very dated .\\n41

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Upon our arrival, there was a SLIGHT odor in bathroom but nothing worth complaining about .\\n43

           The bathroom was adequate with thick, fluffy towels .\\n44

and private .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                              The bathroom was very clean and well appointed with nice towels and toiletries, it was not big, but room enough to do what one needs to .\\n46                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The Tuscan Inn room was quite nicely appointed, the bed was comfortable the chairs   TV adequate, the bathroom reasonably good .\\n47                                                                                                                                       my only real complaint would be that the bathroom does not have a separate vanity area, so 2 people getting dressed had to improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n48                                                                                                                     The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it .\\n50   Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .\\n51

was a good size but the bathroomm was very small .\\n52

.\\n53                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The wash basin was in the room without any privacy and there was a small bathroom for the toilet and bath shower .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The bathroom had not been remodeled in alignment, but it was all very clean and perfectly acceptable .\\n55

         The bathroom had several problems .\\n56

                                                        The shower stall could have been bigger as the bathroom itself was pretty large .\\n58

of a wall, a tiny bathroom so small in fact that the sink had to be in the bedroom .\\n59

space especially in the bathroom .\\n60                                                                                                                                                                                               We may have had an ADA room because it was pretty big with large bathroom ,  it was room 459 ,  and the room had all the amenities we were looking for .\\n61

crack in it, but it did not bother me enough to ask for a different room .\\n63

though, are plenty big .\\n64                                                                                                                                                          Although the rooms were clean and fresh, one of ours had several small problems ,  the phone didn't work, the bathroom door handle was quite loose, and the thermostat didn't work properly .\\n65

for money, the rooms and bathrooms were impeccably clean, fresh linen daily, and the staff extremely helpful and friendly .\\n66

.\\n16                                                                                                                                                                                                                           It is very convenient to the Gloucester Road tube stop, grocery store, drug store and fast food places .\\n17

was delightful, and the service was fast and friendly .\\n18                                                                                                                                                                            The location is just around the corner from the tube, Boots and Waitrose   right next door, close to many restaurants including fast food if you like .\\n19

in the room, but it was completely reserved for the mini, bar service beverages, which completely filled it .\\n20

beginning to run low we went down at 9 .\\n21                                                                                                                                                                                               There were Italian, Indian, British, American fast food, and Thai restaurants very close to the hotel on Cromwell   Gloucester Rds .\\n22

but was chosen from the current uninspired Holiday Inn room service menu, when I ordered a \\u00a36 .\\n23

minutes away to save money .\\n24

foods .\\n27                                                                                                                                                                                                        We ate on evening once at the Garfunkels pub in the mall, it was typical chain restaurant food but fast with good service .\\n28

well presented, cloths were not changed when food got spilt .\\n29                                                                                                                                                                             Not exactly what most tourists are looking for but when you have been out of the states as long as we have you eat fast food when you get the chance !\\n30

 There is no mini, fridge in standard rooms, so you can't store any food ,  the hotel used to have mini, fridges .\\n31

restaurant this morning prior to check out ,  this restaurant is on the first floor and is one of the buffet style breakfasts so lukewarm food and very busy .\\n36

couple of steak places, a number of Indian restaurants and some fast food, so it's convenient for that .\\n45                                                                 Within 200 yards of

                                                 as for the continental breakfast taste was good but became boring after the 3rd day the food served wasnt changed .\\n47

very good ,  although the portions varied significantly depending on the chef that night .\\n48    The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .\\n49

                                        Would not recommend the Patisserie food looked overpriced, pastries were dry !\\n67

everywhere due to $ to pound conversion of course .\\n68                                                                                                                                      there are a variety of priced places to eat in the immediate area, but the food costs are always high,  we ate mostly at pubs, where the beer and scotch were very reasonably priced always !\\n69                                                                                                                                                                                            More than enough food choices

ready, to, eat food from Waitrose .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                 they mark down their food at the end of the day and you can get great deals on everything from sandwhiches to desserts at a fraction of the cost .\\n72

Gloucester Road Tube Station and a host of small shops, pubs and eateries .\\n22

christen my Kindle with the Stephen King novella UR, so went to the Amazon site on my computer and clicked on the button to buy it .\\n0

appeared on my Kindle almost immediately !\\n1                                                                                                                After reading through the introductory guide that loads up automatically at the start and following along it took me almost no time to learn which buttons are where and what each of them do .\\n2                                                   I started reading with the default size without my glasses and noticed I was squinting a bit, so changed to one size larger with a couple button clicks and it was much easier without feeling like the print was too big and took up too much of the page .\\n3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The gadget feeling is underlined by needing to press a button to turn pages .\\n4                                                                                                                                                  It took very little time to get used to having to push a button to turn pages and the screen flash as they turn only really startled me the first few times .\\n5                                                                                                                                 I don't feel the need to push the button ahead of time to prepare for the end of the page at all, which evidently a lot of Kindle 1 owners do since it's a bit more sluggish .\\n6                                                unintended page changes, the awkward way I sometimes have to hold it to keep from hitting buttons, the sometimes slow page refresh, and the screen freezes that now has me traveling with a paper clip lest I need to do a reset while commuting on the train .\\n7

                                the button hinges are on the outside ,  at the edge ,  of the K2 .\\n9

click .\\n10                                                                                                                                                                                                Combine that with the smaller button sizes and one major source of frustration has been instantly eliminated !\\n11

the bottom, I would hit the next page button .\\n16

                  That it doesn't have the quirky, clunky, annoying buttons that filled \\u00be of each side of its predecessor, buttons that caused dozens upon dozens of accidental page turns makes it that much sexier .\\n27

                                 Manipulating that button reminded me of something I'd rather not think about when trying to get work done .\\n30

retreat one, two, three, or even four pages .\\n31

                                                          With the Kindle 2, the buttons have been scaled down to a much more manageable size and are a lot less sensitive .\\n34

the Kindle 1, especially since the context menus that I was used to in the first gen have changed due to the new directional button, but for any Kindle user, this change is a god send .\\n36

             The button layout looks odd because it's so regularly spaced in rows versus the keyboard's staggered style, but it isn't any harder to use than a cellphone's tri, letter entry or blackberry keyboard .\\n40

book page without shearing it from the spine .\\n44

                    Tiny buttons with even tinier text on the buttons .\\n48

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           And the tiny buttons with the even tinier text ?\\n50

   The codes vary depending on which button I press and the most recent code has been 90UGC .\\n52                                                                 Each time this has happened, I have contacted the support team, each time the team member has made me delete the book from the device,they've resent it to me and I've had to do the hold the power button for 20 seconds process each time .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I'm not crazy about the way that the scroll button works either .\\n54

work smoothly .\\n55                                                                                           Sleek style, easy to hold, the white causes it to disappear as suggested in its description, highly transportable, well thought out button placement, easy to use, adjustable font, ease of downloading new books .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                              I love how the content manager is better integrated and I don't have to hit so many buttons to manage my books .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            What I hate ,  I hate the new button positioning .\\n58                                                                                                                                                              Since the K2 is longer and the buttons are near the bottom, its awkward to hold and feels unbalanced in my hands, almost like it will tip over .\\n59                                                                                                                                                                                                                             When I'm trying to go to the next page, I hit the home button by accident a lot .\\n60                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I also hate the fact that you really have to push the buttons hard to change the page .\\n61                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I really liked the extra responsiveness of the K1 buttons   .\\n62                                                                                                                                                                                                            However I was disappointed to discover that I was unable to press the buttons from that position .\\n63

                                                                                                                                                                                  I contemplated changes to my beloved Kindle with dread, I was one of the few who loved the old page, turning buttons .\\n65

.\\n66                                                                                                                                                                   Thankfully the buttons are still at least thumb, size, and may appear hard to press, until you realize that they are hinged on the inside .\\n67                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I like the new size and feel of the buttons .\\n68                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  It is much harder now to accidentally hit the page buttons .\\n69                                                                                                                                                                                                                               But holding the darn thing was a chore without pressing that next button page .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Kind of hard to do when you're inadvertently pressing buttons .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                              Also the keyboard has been redesigned to make things easier as well as added buttons like  menu  which is nice .\\n72                                                                                                                                            I find myself using a large size typeface to compensate for the lack of contrast, but this means frequent  next page  button presses which is extremely annoying .\\n73                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The buttons have a cheap feel .\\n74

The next, previous, back buttons are much smaller and are hard to hit accidentally .\\n78

 Arts&HistoryFan  for pointing out that when you hit the menu button, the time is shown in the top banner .\\n82                                                                                                       Yes, I noticed some of the initial design flaws in the first, generation Kindle ,  the placement of the  next page  buttons, the general sense of flimsiness ,  but I decided I could live with those .\\n83                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Opened the box, press the button and it begins downloading books that I pre, ordered .\\n84

    One thing I didn't like was the page next button failed to work when the text to speech was in use and I wanted to skip ahead .\\n86

 Buttons are accessible, raised for convenience of all involved ,  another big plus for the visually impaired or those with other conditions .\\n88                                                                                       The sound button is raised only slightly ,  fine for VI but potentially problematic for those with arthritis or other issues with fine motor function as it is a relatively thin button that must be pressed slightly .\\n89                                                                                                                                                                                        The buttons are well placed and need a good push to change pages, but not so much that it detracts from your reading .\\n90                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Navigation is much easier with the 5, way button .\\n91                                                                                                                                                               I miss having a dedicated button to deactivate the wireess, but the overall device has improved so much that I will get over the loss quickly .\\n92                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Buttons are not hard to press for me .\\n93                                                                                                                                                                      They do require a bit of pressure, but I like it that way so I can rest my thumbs on the buttons without turning the page accidentally .\\n94                                                                                                          They seem to be in the perfect location, I can grip the K2 easily and do not have to worry about pressing a button on accident but when I need to change the page they are right where I want them .\\n95                                                                                                                                    Moving the cursor to the word in question can be a bit awkward since there is some delay using the 5 direction button, but it's not so awkward as to not use the feature .\\n96                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Getting a free sample wirelessly and then just hitting a button to buy it is great .\\n97

options .\\n98

                                                       The buttons have been made smaller, which fixed the large buttons on the lst generation that made the device hard to hold and frustratingly easy to advance the page .\\n100

on the back as it was on the K1 .\\n102                                                                                                                                                                                  I just have to use the new five way button to highlight the word and look up shows at the bottom without leaving the page .\\n103

                                                       When you look at it, if you don't focus too hard, the little buttons and controls fade away and all you see is the text .\\n109

having to press the next and previous page buttons vertically instead of horizontally .\\n110

paperback page using the font size I like, pushing the  next page  button has become second nature .\\n112                                                                                                                           My one complaint is that I'd like a  previous page  button on both side of the screen, the way there's a  next page  button on both sides, but that's a very minor consideration .\\n113                                                                                                                                             Reading the book in the cover isn't a problem as the front cover readily folds around to the back so that it isn't making the left, edge buttons hard to press .\\n114

downward on the square button .\\n115

gray page background, I actually find it easier on my eyes than stark white .\\n26                                                                 For those of us in the Boomer bulge whose eyesight is failing and taking with it the pleasure of reading ,  and for those with other forms of visual impairment ,  it's nothing less than a miracle .\\n27                                                                                                                                         As advertised, it is very easy on the eyes, combined with font sizing and easy navigation this does what it was meant to do .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                     I am loving the whole concept and read almost a whole book last night with no eye strain at all .\\n29                                                                                                                                                  I have been keeping an eye on the Kindle since the first was brought out and did a lot of research on this product .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                                                    and that is why it's easy on the eyes and uses very little power .\\n31                                                                                                                                                                                                               I use that as well when it gets late and my eyes tire .\\n32                                                                                                                                       The lights are casted from the side of the reader fusing towards the center, which caused me to experience severe eye, strain .\\n33                                                                                                                                            Even without the back light, within fifteen minutes of reading on the sony reader due to the glare, my eyes were hurting .\\n34                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I have not experienced eye, strain .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                    The illuminence of the light is equally distributed onto the screen which causes  no  eye strain .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                      Using the smaller font sizes causes eye strain except in daylight conditions with open windows .\\n37                                                                                                           And reading on the Kindle screen really is pleasant and natural, not to mention that my 47 year old eyes love the possibility of adjusting the text size  !\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                                                 First of all, the Kindle 2 is very easy on the eyes .\\n39                                                                                 Some have said they don't like the black text on a greyish background, but I find the contrast not only more than adequate but easier on the eyes than if the background were white .\\n40                                                                                                                                  A backlighted display is not easy on the eyes for hours on end and the Kindle 2 display is as nice to read as any traditional book .\\n41                                                                                                        I won't be using the feature much anyway because I get a lot more out of a book I'm reading with my eyes and hearing the voice of the storyteller in my mind .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                                                      It's easier on the eyes not to have that light .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                              It's also easy to make the font larger whenever necessary, like when my eyes are tired .\\n44

                                                                                                                                                                                                Truly, this helps in my eyes .\\n46                                                                                                                                                                    Easy on the eyes, font size can be changed and the book will even read to you if you want it too !\\n47                                                                                                                                                             Not having your eyeballs scorched, seared and scarred by the traditional computer screen is really nice .\\n48                                                                                                                           With the great technology of electronic ink, there isn't any back, lighting pounding relentlessly like the desert sun on your tender eyes .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                This means you can read for longer periods of time without eyestrain .\\n50                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The screen is so easy on the eyes .\\n51                                                                                                    The Kindle does not have a screen that taxes the eyes, and allows me to shift some of my time away from the computer for blogs that I would normally read online .\\n52                                                                                                                                                 It's lightweight and allows changes in font size that enables ease of reading no matter how tired your eyes may get .\\n53                                                                                                                                                     I do think the e, ink e, paper is a lot easier on my eyes for reading than the glossy or matte computer screens .\\n54                                                                                                                                                     The screen size is close enough to the size of a paperback book page that it hasn't caused my eyes any problems .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                              It looks very much like a book and is easy on the eyes .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                  8 E, Ink display is easy to read and doesn't strain your eyes and reads better than a printed page .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                                           I can strain to read the text but then close my eye for awhile and listen .\\n58                                                                                                                                                                                                          ,  Eye strain is completely non, existant in my experience .\\n59

                                                                                                                                                                                       It is also very easy on the eyes .\\n61                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I can make the font the perfect size for my eyes .\\n62

                                                                                                   The screen is less obtrusive than the white of a book page, which also helps my eyes from growing tired too quickly .\\n64                                                                                                                                                           I finally got the Kindle, and my worries about the screen tiring my eyes while reading rapidly dissipated .\\n65

slot, lack of a back light, awkward difficult keyboard layout, minimally faster page flipping, and the super, high price .\\n3

                                                                                                                               the BUT comes in and applies to the fact that the price for the downloads has been going up and up .\\n22                                                                                                                                                                                                 since the cost of the kindle is high anyway, the benefit, other than easy storage, was the reduced price of book downloads .\\n23                                                                                                                                                                                 The lack of such an obvious and necessary feature, especially considering the price of the device, really degrades its value and usability .\\n24                                                 I want you to know that ultimately, however, if I want a Kindle I will have to capitulate and accept Amazon's terms because Amazon has a monopoly over their own machine, and I will have to purchase one even at prices I believe are needlessly high for e, book readers .\\n25                                                                                                                                                                                And I know for sure that many print publishers will see this as an opportunity to provide attractively priced paper books as an alternative .\\n26                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  At the steep price of this device we should get better quality components .\\n27                                                                                                                            To have this continuous, high speed, wireless connectivity without the need for a physical computer to upload download onto is truly amazing and makes the price of the Kindle truly irrelevant .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                                     price  , and intuitive operation your parents and grandparents can operate this device, if you are fortunate enough to still have them !\\n29                                                                                                                                                                               As a teacher, I really wanted this machine and have been waiting for the price to drop so that I could give myself the excuse to purchase it .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Disappointing given the prices .\\n31                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The price for new hardbacks on the Kindle is great too .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               After reading the reviews and pondering the price all day, I took the plunge .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                             The ability to plug in headphones and play Miles Davis to drown out the screaming kid while you are reading at the doctors office is priceless .\\n34                                                                                                                                                       If you are searching for a REAL review on the Kindle 2 by someone that was waiting to receive it rather than complaining about price or other issues then here it is .\\n35                          However, I will say, the selection of inexpensive books has been worth the purchase price of this item  especially for those that enjoy reading the classics or nationwide news, it has been a joy to purchase entire collections for a fraction of the cost of purchasing new or even used books .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                                           Those in college, with children or just have a love of reading will likely find the convenience and savings well worth the price .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I found many simply by doing a search on genre's of interest with price  low to high  as a default .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     To justify the purchase price, those functions really need to be there .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The price of these 'classic' titles is pretty hard to beat, too .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                            I was a little miffed when i saw that they would now be charging for the Kindle cover, which was included in the price for the previous version .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                              Mind you, it's the same size as the Kindle 1, and that of most book pages, but I for one dream of something larger without a larger price tag .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                                                 If I have to spend the full puirchase price on the K2 with a K1 still in hand I would have probably waited .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Although pricey, the real value of this purchase is that it got me to read again .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                        But, as far as my reading experience with the kindle 2, I have downloaded so many books and all at a fraction of the original price .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I just hope that the price goes down .\\n46                                                                                                                                            Yes, it costs extra, but they lowered the price on the Kindle 2 so that buying the basic cover costs plus the purchase price of the device itself equals the cost of a Kindle 1 .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                         But given my book storage issues and how much it would cost me to rent a bigger apartment here in the City, I didn't mind paying the current price .\\n48                                                                                                                                                                                                                            That may not be true for everyone, but, as I said, I'm sure the price will eventually come down .\\n49

pay for delayed convenience especially where I am located .\\n50

                                                                                                                                                                         Even if you want to , I think it is way too pricey .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The subscription prices and book prices are really good from what my wife tells me .\\n54

the cover was included in the K2 price, it is still worth buying .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                  It is pricey but if you buy as many books as I do, it will pay for itself within a year due to the low cost of most books .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                                The price of the device itself is the only drawback but if your an avid reader like myself the reward far outways the price .\\n57

proposition makes up for it   .\\n58



due to the insanely high price tag .\\n63

                                                          I thought about buying an eBook reader for a few months and had thought i would go with the B&N Nook until i compared book prices between B&N and Amazon .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Amazons book are priced significantly lower and easier to find in my opinion .\\n72

                                    About a month ago after finishing in one weekend and realizing that I paid $28 for it I thought Kindle's cheaper prices and mobility would be great .\\n74

download samples and buy books for $10 so I have a lot of things I would not buy if I had to pay full price .\\n75

                                                     Only needs to add drivers seat memory, 2, tone perforated leather, xenons, rear seat interior illumination mounted under front seats, and better

           The seat cover was coming out in between the seats .\\n29                                                                                                                              The only for sure complaint I have is the seats seems to hurt my back after I drove for a period of time, this may be because I am use to my silverado truck with leather bucket seats .\\n30                 DON'T rely on your test drive, the seats are Very uncomfortable and when the engine goes into the  econo  mode the vehicle  shifts rocks violently  forward and when leaving the  econo  mode it shifts rocks forward once again which means that the vehicle is  CONTINUOUSLY  SHAKING AND ROCKING .\\n31

smooth !\\n32

15 minutes of driving due to what I see as a design flaw, the seat curvature is too great, and even with the lumbar support all the way retracted, it still feels like there is some type of bar sticking out in the wrong part of my back   .\\n34                                                                                                                However, long, distance comfort  is poor due to hard, narrow and deeply, bucketed seats combined with a very taut suspension which transmits even minor road imperfections through the whole vehicle .\\n35

it is a good car .\\n25                                                                                                                          I'd highly recommend anyone buy this car if they are

       You can not get that comfort with any other automaker other than perhaps Honda .\\n27

comfortable on the road .\\n31                                                                                                                                 The interior is very luxurious and

                                 For the comfort and entertainment of the ride, I like the Camry .\\n33

                            I have had no transmission issues or rattling, the comfort and ride of this vehicle felt to me much more high end then what I had paid .\\n35

.\\n36    I've read other reviews stating that the leather seats were not comfortable for long drives due to lack of cushion support, but that's not been the case for me especially after recently driving from Houston to Key West, Fla .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                    The seats were very comfortable .\\n38                                                                                                                                         The car comfort, looks, performance and fuel economy are great but the paint is a disaster .\\n39

                                      I was not sure at first about trading my 01 Honda Accord but have been more than satisfied with the performance, looks, and comfort .\\n41

quiet .\\n42

     Very low interior noise level, which adds to the long trip comfort .\\n44                                                                                                The ride, comfort, and drive is as expected, however, the quality and reputation of yore are completely gone for the flagship Camry .\\n45                                                                                       Over the month it was in the shop, we rented several different cars and nothing seemed to measure up to the comfort and options of the Camry .\\n46                                                                                                     The seat comfort is not as it was and I found that the gas, brake pedals are offset too much to the left of my body centerline .\\n47

than previous model but comfortable on trips .\\n49

                    The new looks are what attracted it to me initially, but its relatively smooth drive, comfort and reliability sold me on it .\\n93

           The ride is very comfortable, although I'm 6'6  and I didn't think head room was an issue but I do think leg room could be better, I think this is mainly because the back seats have tons of leg room .\\n95

a vibration shimmy problem at 70 mph, visited dealer three times and ended up with changing a new tire and now the ride is even quieter and comfortable .\\n99

interior is upgraded markedly, and although there is a bit less headroom, the added telescoping feature of the steering wheel combined with the greater travel of the seat   yields greater comfort

great gas mileage, I mostly drive city and I am currently receiving 25 .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                       I just love the VCM makes the car give great mileage .\\n44

cylinders, as needed, to improve mileage .\\n47

driving .\\n51                                                                                                                             I had tons of room in my 4Runner, but I needed something that would get better gas mileage w o giving up power .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                                             I am so very disappointed with the gas mileage !\\n53

                                                                                                                              It feels safe, performs well, looks fantastic and gets decent gas mileage for its size .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                   The Accord is better than other those car on gas mileage and reliability .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                   Strangely, the gas mileage is not as good as the Acura but is acceptable .\\n58

                                                                                                                    Gas mileage is horrible too, 20 mpg city highway after 6000 miles .\\n60                                                                                                                                       If you are looking for a car that is affordable and well built this is the car for you bad gas mileage\\n61                                                                                                                                        In reality we have been very disappointed our in city mileage is 16, 17 and highway is better at 27 .\\n62                                                                                                                         While the mileage is not bad it good be better, but as the acceleration is good for a 4 cylinder it's a trade, off .\\n63                                                                                                                                      I am sure as gas prices go up cars will be built to get better mileage at the expense of acceleration .\\n64                                                                                                                                     Good looking inside and out, comfortable and roomy, commendable performance, and excellent gas mileage .\\n65                                                                                                                                       I live in Chicago and drive downtown and back 2 times a week for school and am getting great mileage .\\n66                                                                                                                                                        Only update is after about 5k miles the fuel mileage is less than I had anticipated .\\n67                                                                                                               Everything else such gas mileage, handling, stereo system is fine but it doesn't make up for the loud rattles and wind noise .\\n68                                                                                                                         It's almost embarrassing driving such a nice car around a parking lot and have it sound like a high mileage beater .\\n69                                                                                                                             So I saved $2 K upfront and will also save down the road since the 4 cylinder gets slightly better gas mileage .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                         It is a well built car that runs smooth and gets great gas mileage .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                                 Gas mileage is still getting better though .\\n72                                                                                                                                                                           The gas mileage on the highway is about the same for both models .\\n73                                                                                                                                        Local mileage with the '08 has been about 24 mpg, and about 25 mpg with the '06's that we've leased .\\n74                                                                                                                                                              I decided to go back to Honda as even with high mileage they keep their value .\\n75                                                                                                                          Mileage ,  also not impressive ,  all I can get is about 24mpg, far from the 32 mpg you see on the window sticker .\\n76                                                                                                                                                                           Posted mileage ratings are for those who have a heavy right foot .\\n77                                                                                                                                                            Gas mileage is fantastic especially going from a V8 SUV to a 4 cylinder sedan   .\\n78            I was tempted to go for the V6, but I drive 42 miles one way to work and we have an '07 Odyssey with the variable cylinder management system and unless you're on long highway runs it doesn't get the gas mileage Honda claims .\\n79                                                                       I just love this car ,  and with almost double the highway gas mileage that I was getting with my Grand Cherokee ,  that adds a lot of $$ towards my monthly payment .\\n80                                                                                                                                                                                                            190 hp and superior gas mileage .\\n81                                                                                                                                                                 It wasn't worth saving the little difference in gas mileage for this Honda .\\n82                                                                                                                   The gas mileage is about 45 to the gallon going on the highway with cruise at about 800 or 900 RPM and about 38 going 70 .\\n83                                                                                                                                                  The Gas mileage is good, the acceleration sometime is slow when cold from 1st to 2nd gear .\\n84                                                                                                                                                                                     I hope to get better mileage on extended highway trips .\\n85                                                                                                          I think the mileage would be even better with a 6,

getting 5 mpg less then 06 Accord .\\n132

                                                              So far not super impressed with gas mileage, and comfort, well lets just say my dealership just ordered a new seat cushion for me today

discount .\\n11                                                                                                                               Of course you have the added thrill of paying over $40 a night for parking and whatever your chiropractor bill is when you are done with the beds .\\n12

                                                                                                                                                                       On the other hand, the valet parking attendant bell people were very friendly .\\n14                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Parking is expensive, Rooms are on the small side .\\n15

pain .\\n16                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Only other downer was $38 per night for valet parking .\\n17                                                                                                                                             room was quiet, clean with good beds but very very smallnot a cheap hotelvalit parking was to much expencive but oke its the location\\n18                                                                                                                                                                      Parking is crazy expensive, we drove up from LA so we had a car ,  but otherwise, you really don't need it .\\n19                                                                                                                                                                                                      Parking is expensive   and everything is very much within walking distance .\\n20                                                                                                                                             Valet parking is, in my view, unreasonably high at $38 per night, but again we knew this before we arrived so can't really complain .\\n21                                                                                                                                  As most hotels in the city, parking is expensive so unless you really need a vehicle it\\u0092s cheaper to just buy a MUNI Passport during your stay .\\n22                                                                                                                                                                                  The hotel does have parking, but it is expensive and hard to get around the city while driving .\\n23                                                                                                                                                                  The parking was steep  , so if I had to do it again I would have parked 1 2 block north for about half of that .\\n24                                                                                                                                                                                              Parking at $45 a night was outrageous, but probably worth it to keep your car safe .\\n25                                                                                                                                                                                                                               We did not have a car, hotel parking is expensive .\\n26                                                                                                                                                                                          The valet parking was very convenient and seemed secure as it is attached to the hotel .\\n27                                                                                                                                                                                       A lot of hotel parking garages lots are not on the same premises as the hotel in the area .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                                                            First, the biggest &quot gotcha&quot  is the mandatory valet parking .\\n29                                                                                                                               Not trying to bad mouth the Tuscan, it is a nice place to stay, and if you're not put off by the valet parking, you shouldn't be too disappointed .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                              Valet parking for $40 per night seems a bit steep,but at least the service was efficient and quick .\\n31                                                                                                                                                                          The prize for vallet parking is steep but I think you can expect that anywhere you go in San Francisco .\\n32                                                                                                                                                     Valet parking was $45 per night with tax, but that includes in and out privileges and my car was there whenever I needed it .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Watch out for steep parking rates of about $45 per night .\\n34                                                                                                                                                                                                              This total includes the taxes and tips for mandatory valet parking .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Aside from the parking rate, you won't be disappointed .\\n36                                                                           The other thing that I found disappointing was I can't remember the exact details but something like the charge they quote for parking   was even more than that because there was some sort of a tax .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Onsite parking is available .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                             I called before we ever arrived to inquire about it and was told that parking was no problem at all .\\n39                                                                                              I guess calling to inquire about parking while giving them our name and reservation dates didn't warrant the clerk to inform us that we should make a reservation for our car also .\\n40

                                                                                                                                                          Walgreens has same souvenirs the airport shops do for 1 2 $Do not rent a car, waste of time, money,   no parking !\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                              The valet parking was overpriced, the service was terrible, and the coffe was cold .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          At the hotel, it is valet only parking .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Check for Internet deals and don't pay for their parking .\\n45

                                                                       The hotel, located a few blocks from Fisherman's Wharf as well as Ghiardelli Square, has a nice Italian theme that carries into the lobby as well as the uniforms for the parking valets .\\n47                                                                                                                     Speaking of parking, you're going to have to pay and it's going to have to be valet service, as there are no free self park lots that are part of the hotel .\\n48                                                                                                     Not only is it pricey at $36 day, but having nothing but valet parking means you have no access to your car unless you have one of the valets fetch it from the lot for you .\\n49   Although our room was indeed non, smoking   and we had a king size bed we ended up on the 3rd floor and our room, facing Mason Street, overlooked a concrete multi, story parking lot although if you stood at the window you could see the Coit Tower which was a nicer view !\\n50

with free parking, but the fee is not out of line .\\n52                                                                                                                               Valet parking was $36 a day, but we're not complaining because other SF wharf hotels have charged us a similar fee even without the valet service .\\n53

                                           Normally parking is $36 a night so getting that thrown in was a fantastic steal .\\n58

                                       They allowed this, so we only had to pay the regular parking fee of the hotel .\\n63

                                                                                                       I notice on other reviews the high cost of parking which we didn't have to consider as we were advised you do not need a car to get around SF, and this is quite true .\\n70               All in all, the location was perfect ,  a short walk to the cable cars or bus lines, a Safeway grocery and Walgreens drugs is across the street in a parking garage, type mall, and there are small places to eat breakfast nearby plus an IHOP a few blocks over .\\n71

                                                              Parking is an issue in SF so either pay the $30 .\\n73                                                                                      In addition, the valet parking is apparently handled by an outside contractor, and turned out to be considerably more expensive than we had been told ,  $35 day ,  which seemed very high .\\n74                                                                                                                                                                          Because of the exhorbitant $29 valet parking fee, we only rented a car for Sonoma and Napa for one day .\\n75

excellent .\\n100   my first fill up was 26 mpg mixed city and hwy I only expect it to get better, steering is tight and precise, only complaints are road noise is more than i like but its livable, rain or just dew pours in right on top of the power window controls when the window is cracked, but window guards have fixed that, its a fun car to drive, and for what it is, its comfortable, controls are great, easy to reach, I'm looking forward to a lot of great miles with this car .\\n101

which cost way less than the MacBook, too .\\n4                                                                                                                                                                                       But that aside, I like the availability of software, the new features like the improved Taskbar, Windows Peek, and the Aero environment .\\n5

you get more features, by all means consider Windows 7 the stepping stone to do just that .\\n6                                                                                                                                  After seeing the pricing on the newest MacBooks this week, and the limited features compared to what I currently own, I have to say that now is the right time to consider that switch to PC .\\n7                                                                                                                                                                                                                         These new features make the user experience much more superior than anything Windows has ever offered .\\n8

it isn't needed or the hardware isn't widely adopted yet   .\\n9

                     But what I really like about Windows 7 are the new and improved features it offers .\\n11

                       Having used Windows ME and XP for several years, and before upgrading, Vista, I heard a lot of great things about Windows 7, as well as new features .\\n18

has more features than XP, but many of them didn't make the OS more usable for me .\\n27   Personally I thought Vista was very handsome, what with its transparency, 3, D effects, color schemes, and usability improvements to Windows Explorer, and I believe Windows 7 continues that trend by looking just as sexy , ,  if not more , ,  while at the same time adding its own valuable features and enhancements .\\n28

          I can't tell what positives it offers still, but it's still a nifty upgrade with a lot of nifty features over XP that make for a more fun experience for some, and a more organized experience involving navigating huge catacombs of archives and files .\\n30

                                                      Removing a  feature  from the Programs and Features panel simply disables access to it, but the underlying program files associated with that feature remain on the hard, drive taking up space .\\n46

                                           What I will highlight are a few features of Windows 7 which I have been thoroughly impressed with .\\n50                                                                                                                      Perhaps my expectations were low, since Microsoft OSes tend usually to be just functional   without much pizazz or many  power user  shortcuts and features, but Windows 7 really is a well, crafted OS .\\n51

                                                               Does the new operating system have cool features ?\\n53                                                                                                                              My only complaint would be that I would like to have a family pack available in the Windows Professional flavor or at least the option to purchase some of the professional features separately .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Seems like they actually stepped it down when it should have been stepped up with more features .\\n55

the Windows Live toolbar that includes other features similar to what Google offers .\\n56

A lot of the new finder desktop windows features are awkward working versions of what Mac OS X has had for a couple of years or more .\\n58                                                                                                    If you didn't come over from the bright side you would probably think these features are very cool, so enjoy them for what they are if you've never played around with a Mac enough to be comfortable in that environment .\\n59

                        I had a GPS 10, years ago when I owned a boat that was difficult to use and with very poor accuracy so I had assumed that the road GPS wasn't any better .\\n52

                                               my only real complaint would be that the bathroom does not have a separate vanity area, so 2 people getting dressed had to improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n48                                                                                                                     The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it .\\n50   Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .\\n51

was a good size but the bathroomm was very small .\\n52

.\\n53                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The wash basin was in the room without any privacy and there was a small bathroom for the toilet and bath shower .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The bathroom had not been remodeled in alignment, but it was all very clean and perfectly acceptable .\\n55

         The bathroom had several problems .\\n56

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The shower stall could have been bigger as the bathroom itself was pretty large .\\n58

of a wall, a tiny bathroom so small in fact that the sink had to be in the bedroom .\\n59

space especially in the bathroom .\\n60                                                                                                                                                                                               We may have had an ADA room because it was pretty big with large bathroom ,  it was room 459 ,  and the room had all the amenities we were looking for .\\n61                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The room   and bathroom were perfect in size,  just what is needed .\\n62

crack in it, but it did not bother me enough to ask for a different room .\\n63

though, are plenty big .\\n64                                                                                                                                                          Although the rooms were clean and fresh, one of ours had several small problems ,  the phone didn't work, the bathroom door handle was quite loose, and the thermostat didn't work properly .\\n65                                                                                                                                                                                                        It represents value for money, the rooms and bathrooms were impeccably clean, fresh linen daily, and the staff extremely helpful and friendly .\\n66

towels in the bathroom, and all the usual toiletries, hair, dryer, etc .\\n67

as is the bathroom .\\n68                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The bathroom was also small  it was difficult to close the door once inside to avoid the door hitting you no joke !\\n69                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Some rooms had the bathroom sink outside the bathroom, which we would have preferred, but our sink was inside the bathroom .\\n70

there was a website selling the shampoo listed on the bottle .\\n71

bathroom sink .\\n72

was the bathroom, it was not up to the standard of the rest of the decor but it was clean and large enough .\\n74

bathroom was just okay, but for the price we survived .\\n75

.\\n76

beginning to run low we went down at 9 .\\n21                                                                                                                                                                                               There were Italian, Indian, British, American fast food, and Thai restaurants very close to the hotel on Cromwell   Gloucester Rds .\\n22

but was chosen from the current uninspired Holiday Inn room service menu, when I ordered a \\u00a36 .\\n23

minutes away to save money .\\n24

foods .\\n27                                                                                                                                                                                                        We ate on evening once at the Garfunkels pub in the mall, it was typical chain restaurant food but fast with good service .\\n28

well presented, cloths were not changed when food got spilt .\\n29                                                                                                                                                                             Not exactly what most tourists are looking for but when you have been out of the states as long as we have you eat fast food when you get the chance !\\n30

 There is no mini, fridge in standard rooms, so you can't store any food ,  the hotel used to have mini, fridges .\\n31

restaurant this morning prior to check out ,  this restaurant is on the first floor and is one of the buffet style breakfasts so lukewarm food and very busy .\\n36

price you are paying it is not simply worth it .\\n43

couple of steak places, a number of Indian restaurants and some fast food, so it's convenient for that .\\n45                                                                 Within 200 yards of leaving the hotel and heading to the Tube Station   you have a number of fast food outlets, highstreet Restautants, Pastry shops and supermarkets, so if you did wish to live in your hotel room for the duration of your stay, you could do !\\n46                                                                                                                                                                                                                as for the continental breakfast taste was good but became boring after the 3rd day the food served wasnt changed .\\n47

very good ,  although the portions varied significantly depending on the chef that night .\\n48    The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .\\n49

                                        Would not recommend the Patisserie food looked overpriced, pastries were dry !\\n67

everywhere due to $ to pound conversion of course .\\n68                                                                                                                                      there are a variety of priced places to eat in the immediate area, but the food costs are always high,  we ate mostly at pubs, where the beer and scotch were very reasonably priced always !\\n69                                                                                                                                                                                            More than enough food choices

far it has been extremely reliable .\\n13

                                   I just purchased an Accord Sedan   with leather seats .\\n17                                                                                                                                                               Only needs to add drivers seat memory, 2, tone perforated leather, xenons, rear seat interior illumination mounted under front seats, and better tilt .\\n18                                                                                                                                                                                                          I can also fit three car seats in the back which was the reason I was able to go back the the Honda family .\\n19

                                                             I test drove an EX, L and felt the seats were too firm plus, the EX, L seemed too slow .\\n21                                                                                                                                                                                                                  This Accord has more road noise than

lacks punch after 60, head rest are poor design, lacks driver seat memory rear seat a c, radio system is marginal compared to Bose, Seats are hard and small for a large person .\\n23

            The seats are comfortable, and there is ample leg room in the front and rear .\\n24

                                                   Advise anyone considering the L to drive one for awhile if you can ,  some cannot stand the seats .\\n28

           The seat cover was coming out in between the seats .\\n29                                                                                                                              The only for sure complaint I have is the seats seems to hurt my back after I drove for a period of time, this may be because I am use to my silverado truck with leather bucket seats .\\n30                 DON'T rely on your test drive, the seats are Very uncomfortable and when the engine goes into the  econo  mode the vehicle  shifts rocks violently  forward and when leaving the  econo  mode it shifts rocks forward once again which means that the vehicle is  CONTINUOUSLY  SHAKING AND ROCKING .\\n31

smooth !\\n32

15 minutes of driving due to what I see as a design flaw, the seat curvature is too great, and even with the lumbar support all the way retracted, it still feels like there is some type of bar sticking out in the wrong part of my back   .\\n34                                                                                                                However, long, distance comfort  is poor due to hard, narrow and deeply, bucketed seats combined with a very taut suspension which transmits even minor road imperfections through the whole vehicle .\\n35                                                                                                                                                  At first the seats seemed stiffer than I'd like, but after making a 2 1 2 hour trip, It felt very comfortable once I got the seat and lumbar adjusted to my liking .\\n36

                                            Door closure is solid, leather seats are very comfortable .\\n38

                                                                                                              A little stiffer ride than the xl and xle models I have had, but still comfortable and quiet .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                                  Very comfortable ride and seating .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                 Very low interior noise level, which adds to the long trip comfort .\\n44                                                                                                The ride, comfort, and drive is as expected, however, the quality and reputation of yore are completely gone for the flagship Camry .\\n45                                                                                       Over the month it was in the shop, we rented several different cars and nothing seemed to measure up to the comfort and options of the Camry .\\n46                                                                                                     The seat comfort is not as it was and I found that the gas, brake pedals are offset too much to the left of my body centerline .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                                   Very comfortable, quiet

than previous model but comfortable on trips .\\n49                                                                                                                                                           Feels expensive, yet comfortable with larger interior than my Grand Prix .\\n50

                                                             I feel that the Camry just gets better and better in terms of comfort, styling and performance with each generation .\\n53                                                                                                                     It looks awesome, turns like it's on rails, has a great sound system, and is just comfortable and fun to drive .\\n54

                  My friends say my car is just like a Lexus and I have to agree, very comfortable and beautiful .\\n63                                                                                                                                           Seats are comfortable, but wish the seat bottoms tilted back more into a bucket position .\\n64

         Turns out, it was one of the smoothest, most comfortable rides ever .\\n68                                                                                                                                                                I bought this car smitten by its exterior look and interior comfort .\\n69

                                                                                                                                                                             It is very reliable and

           The seats are way to low to the ground making long drives uncomfortable .\\n74                                                                                                                                                 I do not find the front seats as comfortable as the seats in my old 96 Ford taurus .\\n75                                                                                                                Toyota made many improvements since 03, including more comfortable front seats, better rear seat room and comfort   .\\n76

quite impressive .\\n78                                                                                                                                           My passengers are expecially happy with it and love the room, comfort, and adjustability .\\n79                                                                                                 On longer trips, however, they have a tendency to fall asleep, , which I think emphasizes how comfortable, smooth, and quiet it is .\\n80                                                                                                                                          It is a very comfortable car that gives us options that we never had on previous vehicles .\\n81                                               I test drove and compared similar 4 door sedans like the Maxima, Accord, Mazda6, and noticed that none had all the features,performance,comfort ,safety,and looks that the Camry has .\\n82                                                                                                                                                                                 The navigation works flawlessly, comfortable seats

great,comfortable and gas mileage great .\\n84                                                                                                                                   I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a comfortable ride as well as good fuel economy .\\n85                                                                                                                             The seats were very comfortable on a four and a half hour   trip, and wind and road noise were minimal .\\n86

uncomfortable cockpit I have every been in .\\n90                                                                                                The headrest presses into my head at an uncomfortable

           The ride is very comfortable, although I'm 6'6  and I didn't think head room was an issue but I do think leg room could be better, I think this is mainly because the back seats have tons of leg room .\\n95

a vibration shimmy problem at 70 mph, visited dealer three times and ended up with changing a new tire and now the ride is even quieter and comfortable .\\n99

was that I was going to be in that driver's seat for years to come and I was not going to skimp on the critical comfort factor .\\n104

interior is upgraded markedly, and although there is a bit less headroom, the added telescoping feature of the steering wheel combined with the greater travel of the seat   yields greater comfort

                   The manual transmission lets me control the car better and achieve higher mileage .\\n39

                           Strangely, the gas mileage is not as good as the Acura but is acceptable .\\n58

                                                                                                                    Gas mileage is horrible too, 20 mpg city highway after 6000 miles .\\n60                                                                                                                                       If you are looking for a car that is affordable and well built this is the car for you bad gas mileage\\n61                                                                                                                                        In reality we have been very disappointed our in city mileage is 16, 17 and highway is better at 27 .\\n62                                                                                                                         While the mileage is not bad it good be better, but as the acceleration is good for a 4 cylinder it's a trade, off .\\n63                                                                                                                                      I am sure as gas prices go up cars will be built to get better mileage at the expense of acceleration .\\n64                                                                                                                                     Good looking inside and out, comfortable and roomy, commendable performance, and excellent gas mileage .\\n65                                                                                                                                       I live in Chicago and drive downtown and back 2 times a week for school and am getting great mileage .\\n66                                                                                                                                                        Only update is after about 5k miles the fuel mileage is less than I had anticipated .\\n67                                                                                                               Everything else such gas mileage, handling, stereo system is fine but it doesn't make up for the loud rattles and wind noise .\\n68                                                                                                                         It's almost embarrassing driving such a nice car around a parking lot and have it sound like a high mileage beater .\\n69                                                                                                                             So I saved $2 K upfront and will also save down the road since the 4 cylinder gets slightly better gas mileage .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                         It is a well built car that runs smooth and gets great gas mileage .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                                 Gas mileage is still getting better though .\\n72                                                                                                                                                                           The gas mileage on the highway is about the same for both models .\\n73                                                                                                                                        Local mileage with the '08 has been about 24 mpg, and about 25 mpg with the '06's that we've leased .\\n74                                                                                                                                                              I decided to go back to Honda as even with high mileage they keep their value .\\n75                                                                                                                          Mileage ,  also not impressive ,  all I can get is about 24mpg, far from the 32 mpg you see on the window sticker .\\n76                                                                                                                                                                           Posted mileage ratings are for those who have a heavy right foot .\\n77                                                                                                                                                            Gas mileage is fantastic especially going from a V8 SUV to a 4 cylinder sedan   .\\n78            I was tempted to go for the V6, but I drive 42 miles one way to work and we have an '07 Odyssey with the variable cylinder management system and unless you're on long highway runs it doesn't get the gas mileage Honda claims .\\n79                                                                       I just love this car ,  and with almost double the highway gas mileage that I was getting with my Grand Cherokee ,  that adds a lot of $$ towards my monthly payment .\\n80                                                                                                                                                                                                            190 hp and superior gas mileage .\\n81                                                                                                                                                                 It wasn't worth saving the little difference in gas mileage for this Honda .\\n82                                                                                                                   The gas mileage is about 45 to the gallon going on the highway with cruise at about 800 or 900 RPM and about 38 going 70 .\\n83                                                                                                                                                  The Gas mileage is good, the acceleration sometime is slow when cold from 1st to 2nd gear .\\n84                                                                                                                                                                                     I hope to get better mileage on extended highway trips .\\n85                                                                                                          I think the mileage would be even better with a 6, speed stick shift to drop the tachometer from ~2300 rpm to <2000 rpm at 60 mph .\\n86                                                                                                                                                                      Gas mileage has been improving and is now consistently 29 hwy 22 city .\\n87

has been as expected, it is comfortable on my back, and the gas mileage has been pretty good .\\n91                                                                                                                                                         It is great to drive, has many nice features and gets you there with great mileage .\\n92
